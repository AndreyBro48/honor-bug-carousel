# honor-bug-carousel

This project was created to show different behavior in the user interface of different vendors.

The code looks like a Pager element, but it only displays three elements (current, previous, and next).
Buttons allow users to switch between these elements. 
This functionality works as expected on most devices. 
However, on Honor devices, we have observed a bug.
When the element switches to a different one, there is a flicker in the center of the component.

For example

Xiaomi 11T (Android 14)
